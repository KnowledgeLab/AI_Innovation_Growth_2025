This is where to post questions and memos for the class each week.

### Reading: 
Students are expected to read and reflect on all of the assigned readings each week in advance of the relevant class. Each session there will be one to two modest readings. 

### Questions: 
Every week students will post one question of less than 150 words to this site (also accessible through Canvas) by Monday or Wednesday @ midnight prior to our class session (students will be assigned a Monday or Wednesday time slot). By 1pm Tuesday or Thursday, each student will up-vote (“thumbs up”) what they think are the five most interesting questions for that session. Some of the top-voted questions will be raised and discussed in class, and many more will be discussed in the relevant discussion session.

### Memos: 
Every week students will post one memo in response to the readings and associated topic relevant to an empirical case regarding artificial intelligence, innovation, and/or growth to our course GitHub site (also accessible through Canvas) by Monday or Wednesday @ midnight prior to our class session (students will be assigned a Monday or Wednesday time slot, different from your question slot). By 1pm Tuesday or Thursday, each student will up-vote (“thumbs up”) what they think are the five most interesting memos for that session. The memo should be 300–500 words + 1 custom analytical element (e.g., equation, graphical figure, image, etc.) that supports or complements your argument. These memos should: 1) test out ideas and analyses you expect to become part of your final projects; and 2) involve a custom (non-hallucinated) theoretical and/or empirical demonstration that will result in the relevant analytical element. Because these memos relate to an empirical case, students hope to further develop into a substantial final project, and because they involve original analytical work, they will be very difficult to produce with generative AI, and we strongly discourage you from attempting it. Some of the top-voted memos will form the backbone of discussion in our full class discussion and break-out room sessions.
